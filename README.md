# Purpose:

#Within the scope of the class, this served to show how to build a simple website using Javascript and HTML, and convert a javascript database into something more legible. In
the fictional assignment, it served to show us how we can make a dataset of alien abductions more applicable to the public.

#Results

The website has several filters. When left blank, the HTML will pull all data from data.JS file. The App.JS is coded to respond to the filter, however, and match the text with
anything contained in data.JS for that respective variable. The results will narrow as more filters are added, as the filters will stack with each other (filtering data and city
means it must match both, not either) When the filter runs, only those results will show on the website.


#Drawbacks and improvements

#one major drawback is the site's use of a static database, at least how the class built it. This would require a manual changing of data.js every time a new abduction occurs,
which is not a big deal if infrequent, but can lead to unnessary work in the long run.

#some improvements would be being able to select other ways of narrowing things down, such as a time and date filter (all abductions from 2008 to 2012) or selecting multiple states.
This would allow people to see multiple data pieces instead of searching multiple times. Although I don't know how it would be possible yet, a way to easily export this data, such
as a save to excel option, would greatly benefit any visitors.
